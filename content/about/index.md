Interestingly, I got introduced to programming in my freshman year at [PES University, Bangalore](https://pes.edu/) where I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science (2015-2019) with [9.21 CGPA](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G4UBPBP0mvWZLRdkF_EcpmKKGp7_OA8U/view?usp=sharing).

I'm graduate student pursuing Masters in Computer Science at Arizona State University.

I have worked as a Software Engineer at Aruba Networks for 3 years as a full-stack developer.

I have been awarded as Aruba Recognition award multiple times by Aruba.

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
